# PDF-Reader
This small python code will read PDF for you.

Install libraries:pyttsx3 PyPDF2

And open your file then just run it by providing the path.

BOOM, you can sit back and listen to the content in the file.

Please go through code for further clarifications.

Future commits we can make the algorithm to read it from where ever we want by a voice command.
